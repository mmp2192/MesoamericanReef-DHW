# MesoamericanReef-DHW
This repository contains MATLAB and R scripts for the data analysis behind the manuscript "Catastrophic Bleaching Risks to Mesoamerican Coral Reefs in Recent Climate Change Projections."


Resized daily SST data (0.25 degrees) from each of 10 GCMs as well as MERRA-2 are available here:
https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/GISS/Impacts/Ecosystems/MesoamericanReef/DailySSTs/

The above data portal also contains two .mat files with gridded coordinate information of latitude and longitude values corresponding to the gridded SST data. 

For more information please contact Meridel Phillips (mmp2192@columbia.edu).
